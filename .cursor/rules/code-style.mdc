# Code Style Guidelines

Follow these code style guidelines for consistent and maintainable code:

- Use 2 spaces for indentation as configured in [.cursor.json](mdc:.cursor.json)
- Use camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for classes and components
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Follow JavaScript/TypeScript best practices
- Add descriptive comments for complex logic
- Use meaningful variable and function names

For formatting, we use Prettier with the following configuration:
```json
{
  "singleQuote": true,
  "printWidth": 100,
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "semi": true
}
```
