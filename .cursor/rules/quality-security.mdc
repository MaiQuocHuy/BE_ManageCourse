# Code Quality & Security

## Code Quality
- Write unit tests for critical functionality
- Ensure all code passes linting before commit
- Use TypeScript types/interfaces for better code safety
- Avoid `any` and explicit type assertions when possible
- Avoid duplicate code, extract reusable functions
- Handle errors properly, don't silence exceptions

## Security
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize data before displaying to prevent XSS
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Don't store sensitive information in client-side code
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

## Performance
- Optimize expensive operations
- Be mindful of memory usage
- Use appropriate data structures for the task
- Consider pagination for large data sets
- Implement appropriate caching strategies
